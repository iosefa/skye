# SKYE

Skye is a simple python library for working with 360-degree photos for analysis in forest ecology.

_This library is currently experimental and is under heavy development_.

Current features include the ability to create hemispherical photographs from 3-band (RGB) 360-degree photos, 
sky object detection, and the calculation of the sky view factor.
