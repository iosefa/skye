Introduction
============

Welcome to SKYE, a Python library designed for processing and analyzing 360-degree photos, particularly in the context of forest ecology. This documentation will guide you through the features and functionalities of SKYE.

What is SKYE?
-------------

SKYE is an open-source library aimed at providing efficient and easy-to-use tools for ecologists, researchers, and enthusiasts working with 360-degree photographic data. The library simplifies and automates the process of analyzing hemispherical photographs, which are crucial in forest canopy studies and sky object detection.

Features
--------

SKYE offers a range of features:

- **Hemispherical Photographs**: Convert standard 3-band (RGB) 360-degree photos into hemispherical photographs suitable for ecological analysis.

- **Sky Object Detection**: Identify and classify objects in the sky portion of hemispherical photographs, aiding in ecological assessments.

- **Sky View Factor Calculation**: Compute the sky view factor (SVF) from hemispherical photographs, a vital metric in understanding forest canopy dynamics and light availability.

- **Leaf Area Index (LAI) Calculation**: Calculate the Leaf Area Index, an important parameter in understanding plant canopy structure and health.


Getting Started
---------------

SKYE is easy to install and use. Begin by installing the library using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install skye

Once installed, you can import SKYE in your Python projects:

.. code-block:: python

    import skye
